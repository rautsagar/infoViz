The purpose of this assignment is to get a hands-on experience of building interactive visualizations on the web. The visualization framework/toolkit used is D3. Contained in the directory is a csv file containing data about coffee product sales at a fictional company ( a3-CoffeeData.csv). My aim was to interactive barchart visualization using the data.


The visualization consists of two drop downs and an update button. Once the user chooses an attribute to show on the x-axis, say profit, and for the y-axis, say region, clicking on the update button shows a barchart with accumulated sum of profits over the different regions.


The sets of summation stats were created directly in javascript using D3.
